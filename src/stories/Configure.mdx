## Introduction

# Welcome to Starter Admin NextJS 13 Tailwinds Storybook

Hello, fellow developers! I'm Mohamad Dafa Zakhulhaq Fachrudin, and I'm excited
to introduce you to our starter admin Next.js 13 Tailwinds project's Storybook.

## About the Project

Our project is a Next.js 13-based starter admin template designed to help you
kickstart your admin panel development. Whether you're building a web
application from scratch or enhancing an existing project, our starter admin
provides a solid foundation for your front-end development needs.

## What You'll Find in This Storybook

In this Storybook, you'll find a collection of UI components, modules, and
templates that our project offers. We believe that a consistent and
well-documented UI is essential for efficient development, and that's why we've
put together this Storybook to showcase and provide insight into our design
system.

## Getting Started

If you're new to our project, we recommend starting with the following steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using
   [instructions](https://github.com/DafaZakhulhaq27/admin-hijrah-bersama)
